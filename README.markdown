Nested Attributes Example
=========================

This is an example of how to use the Rails 2.3 nested form attributes magic.
See the Rails documentation on fields_for for more info.

To get started:

    git clone git://github.com/notahat/nested_attributes_example.git
    cd nested_attributes_example
    rake db:migrate
    ./script/server

This is based heavily on
[Eloy Duran's complex form examples](http://github.com/alloy/complex-form-examples/),
which in turn is a fork of
[Ryan Bates' version](http://github.com/ryanb/complex-form-examples/).
