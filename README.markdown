Nested Attributes Example
=========================

This is an example of how to use the Rails 2.3 nested form attributes magic.
See the Rails documentation on fields_for for more info.

This is based heavily on
[Eloy Duran's complex form examples](http://github.com/alloy/complex-form-examples/),
which in turn is a fork of
[Ryan Bate's version](http://github.com/ryanb/complex-form-examples/]).
